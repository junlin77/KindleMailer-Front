# KindleMailer-Front

The frontend implemented in ReactJS for KindleMailer - a web application for searching online book archiving database and sending these books to your ebook reader Kindle (or any email address you wish to).

# Purpose

This project is an extension/enhancement of the other repository - LibgenEmailer (https://github.com/junlin77/LibgenEmailer). The idea to create this web app came from the pain of having to download books and then send them to my Kindle in an additional step. So I built this site with the purpose of replacing that action all within one click.
